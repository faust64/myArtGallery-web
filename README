SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

Install some webserver (nginx would do)
Modify CORE_URL (js/client.js) according to your setup (should point to your
main webserver)
Since this part is completely static, it may as well be served by your main
webservers (front) / multiplying nodes serving this part of your application
would not be as much efficient, as simply adding workers to your nginx
configuration.
